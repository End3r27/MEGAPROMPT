Corvina – Crow Magic System Blueprint
1. Core Concept

Mod Name: Corvina - Fabric 1.21.1 - Minecraft

Theme: Crows as magical companions; player wields a crow staff to channel crow magic.

Core Items/Entities:

Crow Entity – wild and tamed variants.

Corvina Staff – channels crow magic.

Crow Essence – magical resource (mana equivalent).

Crow Rituals – candle-based rituals amplified by nearby tamed crows.

2. Entities
a. Crow Entity

Behavior:

Wild: flies, perches, steals shiny items, avoids player.

Tamed: follows player, perches on shoulder, assists with spells and rituals.

AI Goals:

this.goalSelector.add(0, new SwimGoal(this));
this.goalSelector.add(1, new EscapeDangerGoal(this, 1.2));
this.goalSelector.add(2, new WanderAroundGoal(this, 1.0));
this.goalSelector.add(3, new LookAtEntityGoal(this, PlayerEntity.class, 8.0F));
this.goalSelector.add(4, new FollowPlayerWithItemsGoal(this, 1.2, 5.0F)); // custom goal


Taming:

Use shiny items (gold nuggets, iron nuggets).

Tamed crows automatically perch on player shoulders when sneaking.

Drops:

Crow Feather

Rare: Crow Egg

Chance to drop small shiny items

3. Items
a. Corvina Staff

Stats:

Max Crow Essence: 100 units

Essence Cost per Spell: 10–30 (depending on power)

Usage:

Right-click: cast spell

Shift + Right-click: charge for stronger spell

Enhancements:

Number of tamed crows increases spell power or reduces essence cost

Staff can evolve visually and functionally with use

b. Crow Essence

Stored in staff (item NBT or capability)

Obtained from:

Dropped feathers

Crow performing rituals

Crow collecting shiny items

4. Crow Magic Spells
Spell Name	Type	Mechanics	Essence Cost
Flock Strike	Offensive	Summons 3–5 crows to attack mobs	20
Shadow Veil	Defensive	Temporary invisibility / stealth	15
Item Snatch	Utility	Commands tamed crow to fetch nearby item	10
Ritual Empower	Support	Amplifies candle ritual effects	15
Corvine Flight	Mobility	Short glide / jump boost	20
Dark Feather Trap	Control	Summon crows to scare mobs or block paths	25

Implementation Notes:

Create a CrowSpell abstract class with:

cast(PlayerEntity player, int powerLevel)

getEssenceCost()

Spells are modular: staff checks which spell is selected and executes it.

5. Ritual System

Trigger: Player lights a candle while staff is equipped and a tamed crow is nearby.

Effects:

Particle effects (feathers, shadows)

Buffs to player (night vision, luck, regeneration)

Summon temporary crow minions

Unlock new spells if performed correctly

Optional: Ritual intensity scales with:

Number of nearby tamed crows

Number of candles lit

Event Hook Example:

@SubscribeEvent
public void onCandleLit(PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickBlock event) {
    if(event.getHand() == Hand.MAIN_HAND && playerHasCorvinaStaff(event.getPlayer())) {
        if(playerHasTamedCrowNearby(event.getPlayer())) {
            triggerCrowRitual(event.getWorld(), event.getPos(), event.getPlayer());
        }
    }
}

6. Visual & Audio

Crow Spells: Shadow feather particles, caw sounds synced with attacks

Staff: Glows when essence is full, darker feather motifs appear as it levels

Rituals: Candle flame flickers differently; small flying crows particles

8. Suggested Progression

Implement crow entity with basic wandering AI

Implement taming and shoulder logic

Create the staff item and Crow Essence system

Implement first spell (Flock Strike)

Implement candle rituals interacting with tamed crow

Add more spells and visual/audio polish

Balance essence costs and spawn mechanics

Staffs can be crafted from crow feathers and shiny items or earned via rituals

Taming is item-based and visually/audibly communicated

Crow essence balances magic use; more tamed crows reduce cost

Shoulder crows follow player, assist in combat and rituals

Particle and sound effects provide clear feedback

Player stats (movement, cooldowns, buffs) scale with essence and magic level

Time, weather, and world state modify resource availability and spell potency
