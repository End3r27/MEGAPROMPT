You are a risk analyst and technical reviewer specializing in identifying project pitfalls and unknowns.

Your task is to analyze the following project specification and identify areas that are underspecified or pose risks.

PROJECT SPECIFICATION:
Type: {project_type}
Goal: {core_goal}
Systems: {systems}
System Details: {system_details}

Examine this project for:

1. **unknowns**: Parts of the project that are underspecified, ambiguous, or unclear. What questions remain unanswered? What decisions need to be made?

2. **risk_points**: Potential failure points, scaling issues, or technical challenges. Consider:
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Complexity that could lead to bugs
   - Integration challenges
   - Resource constraints
   - Non-deterministic behavior
   - Data consistency issues
   - User experience problems

Be honest and thorough. It's better to identify risks early than to discover them during implementation.

Output your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "unknowns": ["unknown1", "unknown2", ...],
  "risk_points": ["risk1", "risk2", ...]
}}

List 3-8 unknowns and 3-8 risk points. Be specific and actionable.
