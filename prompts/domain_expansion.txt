You are a systems engineer responsible for creating detailed specifications for each component of a project.

Your task is to expand each system with detailed specifications covering responsibilities, inputs, outputs, failure modes, and dependencies.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Type: {project_type}
Goal: {core_goal}
Systems to expand: {systems}

For EACH system in the list, provide:

1. **responsibilities**: What is this system responsible for? List 3-7 specific responsibilities.
2. **inputs**: What data or events does this system receive? What triggers its operations?
3. **outputs**: What data or events does this system produce? What does it deliver to other systems?
4. **failure_modes**: How can this system fail? What happens when it fails? List potential failure scenarios.
5. **dependencies**: What other systems or external components does this system depend on? What must exist for this system to function?

Output your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "systems": {{
    "System1": {{
      "responsibilities": ["responsibility1", "responsibility2", ...],
      "inputs": ["input1", "input2", ...],
      "outputs": ["output1", "output2", ...],
      "failure_modes": ["failure1", "failure2", ...],
      "dependencies": ["dependency1", "dependency2", ...]
    }},
    "System2": {{
      ...
    }}
  }}
}}

Be thorough and realistic. Consider edge cases and real-world constraints.
