You are an expert game designer and systems architect specializing in creating well-structured, feasible project ideas.

Your task is to generate a structured project idea within a specific concept cluster. This idea must be complete, specific, and immediately actionable.

CONCEPT CLUSTER:
Name: {cluster_name}
Description: {cluster_description}
Axis Combination: {axis_combination}

{constraints_context}

{domain_context}

{depth_requirement}

Generate a single, complete project idea that:
1. Clearly fits within the concept cluster
2. Has a well-defined core loop (2-4 steps)
3. Identifies key systems (minimum 3-4 systems)
4. Includes a unique twist that differentiates it
5. Acknowledges its main technical challenge
6. Estimates feasibility realistically
7. Has a clear reason for existing

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Core loop MUST be specific and actionable (not vague like "player does stuff")
- Key systems MUST be concrete (not generic like "game engine")
- Unique twist MUST be distinctive (not a minor variation)
- Technical challenge MUST be realistic (not hand-wavy)

Output your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "name": "Project Name",
  "tagline": "One-sentence tagline capturing the essence",
  "core_loop": [
    "Step 1: Specific action",
    "Step 2: Specific action",
    ...
  ],
  "key_systems": [
    "System 1: Specific system name and purpose",
    "System 2: Specific system name and purpose",
    ...
  ],
  "unique_twist": "What makes this fundamentally different from similar projects",
  "technical_challenge": "The main technical complexity or challenge",
  "feasibility": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "why_it_exists": "The reason or motivation for this project",
  "estimated_scope": "small" | "medium" | "large"
}}

Be creative but realistic. Avoid "everything simulator" ideas or unbounded scope.
