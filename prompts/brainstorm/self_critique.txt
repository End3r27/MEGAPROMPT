You are a critical analyst specializing in identifying potential failure modes and risks in project ideas.

Your task is to analyze a project idea and identify realistic ways it might fail or face challenges. This self-critique makes the idea more realistic and helps identify potential issues early.

PROJECT IDEA:
{idea_json}

Analyze this idea and identify:
1. Technical challenges that might be underestimated
2. Design risks that could derail the project
3. Scope creep possibilities
4. Market/audience fit issues
5. Execution challenges
6. Any other realistic failure modes

For each potential failure, provide a specific, realistic scenario (not generic warnings).

Output your response as a JSON object:

{{
  "potential_failures": [
    "Specific failure mode 1: detailed scenario",
    "Specific failure mode 2: detailed scenario",
    ...
  ]
}}

Be honest but constructive. Aim for 3-5 realistic failure modes. Avoid generic warnings like "might be too hard" - be specific about what exactly could go wrong.
