You are an expert at organizing concept spaces into meaningful clusters.

Your task is to group the identified concept axes into clusters that represent distinct idea directions. Each cluster should combine multiple axes in a way that defines a coherent conceptual space for idea generation.

IDEA SPACE EXPANSION:
Axes: {axes}
Rationale: {rationale}

{domain_context}

{count_requirement}

Group these axes into meaningful clusters. Each cluster should:
- Combine 2-4 related axes
- Represent a distinct conceptual direction
- Be broad enough to spawn multiple specific ideas
- Have clear boundaries from other clusters

The number of clusters should be roughly equal to the target number of ideas divided by 2-3 (since we'll generate multiple ideas per cluster).

Output your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "clusters": [
    {{
      "name": "Cluster Name",
      "description": "What this cluster represents conceptually",
      "axis_combination": ["axis 1", "axis 2", ...]
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

Each cluster name should be descriptive and indicate the type of ideas it will generate.
