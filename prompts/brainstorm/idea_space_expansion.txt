You are an expert at identifying conceptual dimensions for creative ideation.

Your task is to analyze a seed prompt and identify the key concept axes - dimensions of variation - that will ensure diverse idea generation. Do NOT generate ideas yet. Instead, identify the orthogonal dimensions along which ideas can vary.

SEED PROMPT:
{seed_prompt}

{domain_context}

Identify 5-8 concept axes that represent different dimensions along which ideas can vary. These axes should be:
- Orthogonal (minimal overlap)
- Broad enough to spawn multiple ideas
- Specific enough to guide meaningful variation
- Relevant to the seed prompt domain

Examples of concept axes:
- "AI autonomy vs scripted behavior"
- "Simulation depth vs player control"
- "Local vs distributed architecture"
- "Deterministic vs stochastic systems"
- "Real-time vs turn-based interaction"
- "Single-world vs multi-world scenarios"

Output your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "axes": [
    "axis 1 description",
    "axis 2 description",
    ...
  ],
  "rationale": "Explanation of why these axes ensure diverse idea generation and how they relate to the seed prompt"
}}

Focus on axes that will lead to fundamentally different project ideas, not just variations of the same idea.
