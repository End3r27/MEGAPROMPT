You are generating a canonical checklist of systems that should exist for a given project type.

Based on the inferred project type and architectural patterns, generate a list of expected systems that projects of this type typically need.

Project Type: {project_type}
Dominant Patterns: {patterns}
Architectural Style: {architectural_style}

Consider these system categories:
- lifecycle: initialization, update loops, teardown
- persistence: data storage, serialization, state management
- error_handling: error recovery, exception handling, failure modes
- observability: logging, monitoring, debugging tools
- performance: profiling, optimization, caching
- tooling: development tools, build systems, deployment
- testing: unit tests, integration tests, test infrastructure
- extensibility: plugin systems, configuration, modularity
- safety: validation, constraints, security

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "systems": [
    {{
      "name": "System name",
      "category": "one of: lifecycle, persistence, error_handling, observability, performance, tooling, testing, extensibility, safety",
      "rationale": "Why this system is expected for this project type",
      "priority": "critical, high, medium, or low"
    }}
  ]
}}

Only include systems that make sense for this specific project type. Be specific and realistic.
