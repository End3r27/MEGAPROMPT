You are generating a canonical checklist of systems that should exist for a given project type.

CRITICAL: Adjust expectations based on project INTENT. A base_image or template should NOT be expected to have executable systems.

Project Type: {project_type}
Dominant Patterns: {patterns}
Architectural Style: {architectural_style}
Project Intent: {intent_type}
Is Minimal: {is_minimal}
Maturity Level: {maturity_level}

Consider these system categories:
- lifecycle: initialization, update loops, teardown
- persistence: data storage, serialization, state management
- error_handling: error recovery, exception handling, failure modes
- observability: logging, monitoring, debugging tools
- performance: profiling, optimization, caching
- tooling: development tools, build systems, deployment
- testing: unit tests, integration tests, test infrastructure
- extensibility: plugin systems, configuration, modularity
- safety: validation, constraints, security

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "systems": [
    {{
      "name": "System name",
      "category": "one of: lifecycle, persistence, error_handling, observability, performance, tooling, testing, extensibility, safety",
      "rationale": "Why this system is expected for this project type",
      "priority": "critical, high, medium, or low"
    }}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. If intent_type is "base_image", "template", or "scaffold", ONLY include foundational systems (security, hygiene, documentation) - NOT executable systems
2. If is_minimal is true, be very conservative - only critical systems
3. If maturity_level is "foundation" or "template", exclude production systems
4. For executable_utility: include entrypoint, error handling, logging
5. For base_image: only include security, size optimization, dependency hygiene
6. For template: include documentation, examples, setup instructions

Only include systems that make sense for this specific project type AND intent. Be specific and realistic.
