You are an expert at analyzing user prompts and extracting their true intent.

Your task is to analyze the following user prompt and extract its core intent, removing any fluff or ambiguity.

USER PROMPT:
{user_prompt}

Extract the following information:

1. **project_type**: What type of project is this? (e.g., "simulation game", "web application", "data analysis tool", "mobile app")
2. **core_goal**: What is the primary objective or goal? State it in one clear, concise sentence.
3. **user_expectations**: List the key expectations or requirements the user has for this project. Be specific.
4. **non_goals**: What should this project explicitly NOT do or include? (If not mentioned, leave as empty array)

Output your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "project_type": "string",
  "core_goal": "string",
  "user_expectations": ["expectation1", "expectation2", ...],
  "non_goals": ["non-goal1", "non-goal2", ...]
}}

Be precise and avoid assumptions. Focus only on what is explicitly stated or strongly implied in the prompt.
