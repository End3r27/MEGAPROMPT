You are detecting intent drift between an original design intent and the current codebase implementation.

Compare the original intent (from a prompt/design document) with what was actually implemented (based on codebase structure).

Original Intent:
{original_intent}

Current Codebase Structure:
{codebase_structure}

Identify discrepancies where:
- Features mentioned in the original intent are not present
- Architectural decisions differ from what was planned
- Systems that were supposed to exist are missing

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "drifts": [
    {{
      "original_intent": "What was originally intended/designed",
      "current_state": "What actually exists in the codebase",
      "severity": "critical, medium, or low"
    }}
  ]
}}

Only report significant discrepancies that represent actual drift from the original design. Minor implementation differences are not drift.
