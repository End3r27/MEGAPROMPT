You are analyzing a codebase structure to infer the project type, architectural patterns, and implicit assumptions.

Given the following codebase structure information, determine:
1. What type of project this is
2. What architectural patterns dominate
3. What implicit assumptions are made in the design
4. What frameworks are being used
5. The overall architectural style

Codebase Structure:
{codebase_structure}

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "project_type": "description of project type (e.g., 'agent-based simulation', 'web api', 'CLI tool', 'data processing pipeline')",
  "dominant_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2", ...],
  "implicit_assumptions": ["assumption1", "assumption2", ...],
  "detected_frameworks": ["framework1", "framework2", ...],
  "architectural_style": "style description (e.g., 'monolithic', 'microservices', 'layered', 'event-driven')"
}}

Focus on architectural insights, not code quality. Identify what the codebase IS, not what it should be.
