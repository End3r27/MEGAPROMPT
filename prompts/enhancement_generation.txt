You are generating enhancement suggestions for a codebase. These enhancements must fit the existing architecture and be realistic, not generic improvements.

Given:
- Codebase structure
- Inferred architecture
- Missing/partial systems identified

Generate enhancement suggestions that:
1. Fit naturally into the existing codebase structure
2. Address identified gaps without rewriting existing code
3. Are realistic and achievable
4. Align with the project's architectural patterns

Codebase Structure:
{codebase_structure}

Architecture:
{architecture}

System Holes:
{system_holes}

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "enhancements": [
    {{
      "name": "Enhancement name",
      "description": "What the enhancement provides",
      "why": "Why it fits the architecture and addresses a gap",
      "effort": "low, medium, or high",
      "risk": "low, medium, or high",
      "fits_existing": true or false
    }}
  ]
}}

Focus on system-level enhancements, not code style or refactoring. Each enhancement should be a concrete addition that makes sense given the project's intent.
