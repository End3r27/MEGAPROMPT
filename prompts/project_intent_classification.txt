You are classifying the intent/purpose of a codebase project.

Given the following structural information, determine what kind of project this is.

Codebase Structure:
{codebase_structure}

Heuristic Observations:
{heuristics}

Possible intent types:
- executable_utility: Standalone executable tool/service (has entrypoint, CLI, or API)
- base_image: Docker base image or foundational layer (Dockerfile but minimal/no code)
- runtime_environment: Runtime environment setup (Python, Node, etc. environment)
- build_image: Build/CI image with toolchains (compilers, build tools)
- library_image: Library or dependency container (packages but no entrypoint)
- template: Template/scaffold project (minimal code, README with instructions)
- scaffold: Starter template (skeleton structure)
- library: Reusable library code (modules but no entrypoints)
- unknown: Cannot determine with confidence

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  "intent_type": "one of the intent types above",
  "confidence": "high, medium, or low",
  "reasoning": "Explanation of why this intent was chosen, referencing heuristics and structure",
  "is_minimal": true/false,
  "maturity_level": "foundation, template, prototype, production, or unknown"
}}

Important guidelines:
- If heuristics suggest base_image, template, or scaffold, mark is_minimal as true
- If project has no executable code and no entrypoint, likely base_image or template
- If project has executable code AND entrypoint, likely executable_utility
- Maturity: foundation = base layer, template = starter code, prototype = working but incomplete, production = complete system
- Be conservative: if uncertain, use "unknown" with low confidence
